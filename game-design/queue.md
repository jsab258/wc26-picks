## Why this file exists

On 3 August I dispatched five Windows builds in two hours and, four times,
**ended the turn instead of picking up the next thing** — twenty, thirty-two,
nineteen and twenty-eight minutes with nothing of mine landing. AUTO MODE rule 2
already forbade exactly that, in my own words, and I broke it four times in one
afternoon.

The cause was not forgetting the rule. It was that **the moment after a dispatch
is a decision point**, and a decision point at the end of a long turn is where
turns end. Nothing was written down, so "what next" meant re-deriving priorities
from a 400-line roadmap, and that is enough friction to lose to.

So the queue is written BEFORE the dispatch, and the rule becomes mechanical:
dispatch, then take the top non-CI item off this list. No judgement required at
the point where judgement was failing.

It lives in the repository rather than in a task list because the container is
ephemeral and the task list is not — rule 12's principle, applied to my own
scheduling instead of to CI's output.

## How to use it

- **Every item is sized to fit inside one build round trip (~28 min).** An item
  that cannot be finished in that window gets split until it can, or it will be
  abandoned half-done when the build lands.
- **CI-needed items are marked.** Those get batched into the next dispatch;
  they are never a reason to stop working.
- Take from the top. Move finished items out — this file records what is NEXT,
  not what happened. Done work is in the git log.

## Now

1. **The companion sees a knifing WORSE than a stranger does, and the excuse is
   gone.** `companionSight[with=Goran rung=0 street=1 dist=1.7m]` — she is at
   the player's shoulder, 1.7 metres, and the street out-sees her. The standing
   hypothesis in the code comment was that `CompanionHost.Ask` has no proximity
   requirement so she gets recruited across the city; the printed distance
   refutes it outright. This is the one failing gate in the run and it is Core,
   so it answers here in seconds rather than in twenty-eight minutes. Read
   `Witnesses.Resolve`'s rung computation against a witness standing at 1.7m
   and find what demotes her.
2. **The player is a shop dummy, and no code fixes that.** The noon frame shows
   a featureless pale figure with a blue hip band. `CharacterPrefab.BodyModel`
   is `Assets/Characters/X Bot.fbx` — Mixamo's free mannequin. The 44 imported
   files are animation clips. So `bodyDressed=1` is TRUE and says nothing: the
   coat went onto a placeholder. Nothing to build; the roadmap now says so and
   it is Jafar's purchase. **Do not spend another hour making a dummy prettier.**
3. **`bodyDressed` counts renderers, so it cannot see how much of the body is
   dressed.** One renderer flesh, one coat, `Dressed=1` — and if the coat lands
   on the smaller mesh the figure reads naked while the number reads clothed.
   The metric that would have caught it is area, not count: vertices or bounds
   volume per material. This is the standing "turn a still into a number" item
   with a specific target, and it will still be right when a real mesh arrives.
4. **The arms: the bracket is dispatched, do not guess ahead of it.** *(CI)*
   `restArmDrop=0.0`, `liveArmDrop=118.8`, and `preArmDrop` lands with the
   build on `9ae6ff6`. Already ~119 pre-solve means the Animator's default pose
   does it; 0 pre-solve means our `Swing` does. Read it, then act.
5. **First engine-side evidence that rest days differ.** *(CI)*
   `workNoonCrowd` / `restNoonCrowd` land in the same build. The Core says the
   crowd should thin at the weekend; nothing has ever looked.

## Next

6. **Raise the population instead of cutting districts.** Measured, and it
   reverses the plan: seven districts at 1,400 people gives 43.5 distinct faces
   a week against 47.4 for three at 700, and 2,100 beats the cut outright. What
   is NOT measured is whether a fuller city still reads as a port rather than a
   crowd — that is a question for a still. Change the headcount, look, decide.
7. **Tier the cast — and the runtime is not the constraint.** All three sides
   measured. Design: 47 distinct faces a week, 13 near enough to read, a knee at
   ~50 people covering 92% of a resident's week. Witnesses: no fewer than ~20
   near an event. Runtime: 68 rigs cost 1.1ms of a 12ms budget. **The machine
   does not bound the cast at fifty; only authoring does.**
8. **M17.2 voices** — no longer held. The writing verdict came back 78 and the
   risk it was gating (paying to voice something that needs rewriting) is
   retired. Note this is a SPEND and Jafar has not authorised it.
9. **Six cards still lack example lines**, down from sixty. Small, local, no key
   needed to identify them.

## Blocked, and on whom

- **A character mesh.** Only Jafar can buy one, and it is now the single
  largest immersion gap in the project — see roadmap 17.1b.
- **Any further API spend.** The 3 August authorisation covered two tasks, both
  done, ~£0.85. Nothing else is approved and nothing else gets spent.

## Done, kept here only until the next tidy

- The upside-down player, closed by looking at the frame: two independent
  faults in our own rig, both fixed, a figure on its feet in the noon still.
- The nameplate that measured 2,119 times the frame height — the screen-rect
  helper projected two diagonal corners of a rotating box. Now 0.825.
- The rest days were never unrun; I read screenshot filenames as run length.
- Parallel builds; the work queue and its checker; the Tier-2 generator's
  thirteen writing rules with a no-key self-test; example lines for 54 of the
  60 generated cards; the conversation probe and a measured 78; per-character
  geometric cost; M19 input parity.

## How to keep this file honest

- **Dispatch, then immediately take item 1 of Now.** A build in flight is a
  reason to switch tasks, never a reason to stop.
- **Arming a watcher is the PRECONDITION for ending a turn, not permission to
  end one.** Both are required and only one of them feels like progress.
- **Batch Game-layer changes, and dispatch hypotheses in parallel** — each build
  keeps its own verdict under `sim-shots/runs/<sha>.txt`, so concurrent builds
  are concurrent answers.
- **Prefer a local answer.** Before dispatching, ask whether the question is
  actually about Unity. Item 1 above is not.

## Standing work

**This section never empties, and that is its entire job.** The queue ran dry on
3 August after an hour of good work, because every item was sized to fit inside
one build round trip — so an hour of good work consumed the list, and an empty
list read as an empty afternoon. Three gaps of 21, 28 and 28 minutes followed.

When `## Now` has nothing startable in it, the next action is to take one of
these and decompose it into `## Now` — NOT to end the turn. Running out of short
items is a refill signal, not a stop signal.

- **M21, the two ledgers.** Empire growth, law as a tool, what expansion costs
  you. Entirely unbuilt, entirely Core, so entirely doable here without a round
  trip. This is the largest piece of unwritten game left.
- **M22, the shape of a playthrough.** Onboarding, pacing, replayability,
  succession. Also unbuilt and also Core-shaped.
- **Read a system and write down what it actually does.** Every system in this
  project has at least one comment that is now false; three were found today,
  one of them in the file being edited at the time. The supply is effectively
  unlimited and each one found is a bug that would otherwise have been believed.
- **Turn a still into a number.** Four faults have now been found by opening a
  frame and none by a gate — the newest being a naked body with a metric
  reporting it clothed. Anything a frame shows that no metric names is a metric
  worth adding.
