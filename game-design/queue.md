## Why this file exists

On 3 August I dispatched five Windows builds in two hours and, four times,
**ended the turn instead of picking up the next thing** — twenty, thirty-two,
nineteen and twenty-eight minutes with nothing of mine landing. AUTO MODE rule 2
already forbade exactly that, in my own words, and I broke it four times in one
afternoon.

The cause was not forgetting the rule. It was that **the moment after a dispatch
is a decision point**, and a decision point at the end of a long turn is where
turns end. Nothing was written down, so "what next" meant re-deriving priorities
from a 400-line roadmap, and that is enough friction to lose to.

So the queue is written BEFORE the dispatch, and the rule becomes mechanical:
dispatch, then take the top non-CI item off this list. No judgement required at
the point where judgement was failing.

It lives in the repository rather than in a task list because the container is
ephemeral and the task list is not — rule 12's principle, applied to my own
scheduling instead of to CI's output.

## How to use it

- **Every item is sized to fit inside one build round trip (~28 min).** An item
  that cannot be finished in that window gets split until it can, or it will be
  abandoned half-done when the build lands.
- **CI-needed items are marked.** Those get batched into the next dispatch;
  they are never a reason to stop working.
- Take from the top. Move finished items out — this file records what is NEXT,
  not what happened. Done work is in the git log.

## Now

### Startable right now, in order

1. **Read the build carrying the crowd separation and the 180 yield.** Both
   are now enforcement rather than measurement, so the numbers to read are
   whether they WORKED and whether they broke anything: `crowdGapMedian`
   should rise off 0.00 without the confabs collapsing (`confabs` was 74), and
   `lineYielded` should track `lineCrossedLive` exactly — if it drifts below,
   a crossing was detected and not acted on.
2. **`claimOverheard` with a bystander planted.** First reading was 0 for a
   whole run because nobody happened to be within fourteen metres. A second
   host now stands two metres away for the duration of the claim and is put
   back afterwards. If it still reads 0 the fault is in the acoustics path,
   not the world.
3. **`soundsDropped` and `soundsPeak`.** The voice budget has a choke point
   for the first time. Zero drops over a run means either the street never
   gets busy enough to need it or the gate is not in the path — and the peak
   bus says which.
4. **`contrastFailing` and the worst pair.** First reading of whether the
   panels can actually be read. Reported, not gated: some pairs are dim on
   purpose, and which ones are intentional is a judgement for Jafar off the
   list rather than a bound for me to pick.
5. **`staminaLow`/`staminaHigh`.** Both at 1.000 means the sim never runs far
   enough for the breathing model to matter — a finding about the sim, not the
   model. Pinned at 0 means the drain is too steep.
6. **Promote the gate-label keys to REQUIRED** in `verdict-keys`. They always
   print now. Two or three landed runs first; some labels build their text
   conditionally.
7. **Jafar runs `BODIES.bat` ~10:00 CEST**; reminder armed for 07:55 UTC.
8. **Keep retiring the reach ledger** (56, from 71 last night). What is left is
   mostly genuinely-blocked UI surfaces plus the type scale, which wants the UI
   to stop setting sizes by hand — a real refactor rather than a wiring.

## What last night settled, in one line each

Full accounts are in the commit messages; this is the index, and it is here
only so a reader does not re-open a closed question. **Anything with a number
beside it was measured, not judged from a still.**

- The ledger screen called the player by their database key in four rumours,
  and printed one repeated reason three times where three different ones fit.
  Both fixed and confirmed green.
- The escort was recruited by walker-list position, twenty-four metres away;
  she is picked by proximity now and arrives at nine.
- The third competence brick is a WEIGHT, not a face count, and it runs: thirty
  rumours from your own face against two from your crew.
- `ALL GATES` prints every run, so the 35 diagnostics that were readable only on
  a failing run are readable on a passing one. Confirmed landing.
- A comment took the build step past a hard size limit and broke dispatch
  outright; `workflow-size` now catches that at commit time.
- Bubbles are fine — 166 samples, median zero overlapping pairs. The peak of
  116 was a real crowd pile-up, not the normal state.
- The camera never stands in front of the player: twenty shots, zero blocked.
  Three stills' worth of eye-judgement about foreground clutter was wrong.
- Overhearing exists: an alibi told to one person is now heard by whoever is
  close enough to make out the words, capped below knowledge.
- Twenty seconds of watching somebody now carries an identification floor into
  what they witness. It never did.
- The grade cools when the player is exposed and warms when hidden — written,
  tested and unwired since it was written.
- **`workflow_dispatch` does not pin a commit.** Four builds were dispatched at
  named shas and none of those shas was ever built. Watchers must ask whether a
  run CONTAINS the commit, not whether one is named after it.

## Next

**CORRECTED — "raise the population" and "make the street busier" are two
different changes and this queue conflated them.** `CrowdWalkerCap = 12` bounds
how many bodies are out of doors within earshot, whatever `CityPlan.Count` is,
and it was set from measurement rather than ambition: at 3,000 residents there
were 333 people standing within 34m of the bar door, so the caps were not
thinning a crowd, they were choosing 28 out of a mob and spawning every one on
top of the player. Raising the count from 700 to 1,400 buys FAMILIARITY — 43.5
distinct faces a week against 47.4 — and changes the frame not at all. Whether
a dozen people in a plaza reads as a street or as a demonstration is a judgement
for Jafar off a still, not a number for me to move against a measured decision.


6. **Raise the population instead of cutting districts.** Measured, and it
   reverses the plan: seven districts at 1,400 people gives 43.5 distinct faces
   a week against 47.4 for three at 700, and 2,100 beats the cut outright. What
   is NOT measured is whether a fuller city still reads as a port rather than a
   crowd — that is a question for a still. Change the headcount, look, decide.
7. **Tier the cast — and the runtime is not the constraint.** All three sides
   measured. Design: 47 distinct faces a week, 13 near enough to read, a knee at
   ~50 people covering 92% of a resident's week. Witnesses: no fewer than ~20
   near an event. Runtime: 68 rigs cost 1.1ms of a 12ms budget. **The machine
   does not bound the cast at fifty; only authoring does.**
8. **M17.2 voices** — no longer held. The writing verdict came back 78 and the
   risk it was gating (paying to voice something that needs rewriting) is
   retired. Note this is a SPEND and Jafar has not authorised it.
9. **Six cards still lack example lines**, down from sixty. Small, local, no key
   needed to identify them.

- **IS FIFTY-SIX CONVERSATIONS A RUN TOO MANY?** A judgement about how
  talkative a street should feel, which is Jafar's off a still and not mine
  off a number. The history: 16–42 a run (mean ~24) under the old flat-3.0m
  road test, 7 after the walking pace slowed, and 56 now the test asks about
  junctions instead. So the junction rule is more permissive than the old one
  was even before the regression. It is defensible — the old test was
  rejecting 96% of pairs by asking for something the world never produces —
  but "defensible" is not the same as "right", and the number that decides it
  is how the street READS, not how it counts. Worth a look at the night still
  once the speech bubbles stop overlapping.

## Blocked, and on whom

- **THE MONEY DOES NOT MATCH THE DECADE, and it is a decision rather than a
  fault.** The cast deals in shillings, half a crown, pence and two-and-six —
  pre-decimal British currency, gone in 1971 — while `Tier2Gen` dates the world
  to the eighties and nineties by listing CDs, pagers and car phones as
  in-period. Seven references across the sixty cards, now counted by `--audit`
  and deliberately not rejected: refusing sixty cards over an unmade decision is
  the ratchet rule 5 warns about. Two ways out, both cheap, and it is Jafar's
  call: move the era back, or move the money forward. Worth noting the era is
  load-bearing rather than flavour — a late-analog city is what makes missed
  calls, wiretaps and being unreachable into mechanics.

- **A character mesh.** Only Jafar can buy one, and it is now the single
  largest immersion gap in the project — see roadmap 17.1b.
- **Any further API spend.** The 3 August authorisation covered two tasks, both
  done, ~£0.85. Nothing else is approved and nothing else gets spent.

## Done, kept here only until the next tidy

- The upside-down player, closed by looking at the frame: two independent
  faults in our own rig, both fixed, a figure on its feet in the noon still.
- The nameplate that measured 2,119 times the frame height — the screen-rect
  helper projected two diagonal corners of a rotating box. Now 0.825.
- The rest days were never unrun; I read screenshot filenames as run length.
- Parallel builds; the work queue and its checker; the Tier-2 generator's
  thirteen writing rules with a no-key self-test; example lines for 54 of the
  60 generated cards; the conversation probe and a measured 78; per-character
  geometric cost; M19 input parity.

## How to keep this file honest

- **Dispatch, then immediately take item 1 of Now.** A build in flight is a
  reason to switch tasks, never a reason to stop.
- **Arming a watcher is the PRECONDITION for ending a turn, not permission to
  end one.** Both are required and only one of them feels like progress.
- **Batch Game-layer changes, and dispatch hypotheses in parallel** — each build
  keeps its own verdict under `sim-shots/runs/<sha>.txt`, so concurrent builds
  are concurrent answers.
- **Prefer a local answer.** Before dispatching, ask whether the question is
  actually about Unity. Item 1 above is not.

## Standing work

**This section never empties, and that is its entire job.** The queue ran dry on
3 August after an hour of good work, because every item was sized to fit inside
one build round trip — so an hour of good work consumed the list, and an empty
list read as an empty afternoon. Three gaps of 21, 28 and 28 minutes followed.

When `## Now` has nothing startable in it, the next action is to take one of
these and decompose it into `## Now` — NOT to end the turn. Running out of short
items is a refill signal, not a stop signal.

- **M21, the two ledgers.** Empire growth, law as a tool, what expansion costs
  you. Entirely unbuilt, entirely Core, so entirely doable here without a round
  trip. This is the largest piece of unwritten game left.
- **M22, the shape of a playthrough.** Onboarding, pacing, replayability,
  succession. Also unbuilt and also Core-shaped.
- **Read a system and write down what it actually does.** Every system in this
  project has at least one comment that is now false; three were found today,
  one of them in the file being edited at the time. The supply is effectively
  unlimited and each one found is a bug that would otherwise have been believed.
- **Turn a still into a number.** Five faults have now been found by opening a
  frame and none by a gate — the newest being rumour text printed backwards
  across `day5_night` while three separate orientation metrics read perfect.
  Anything a frame shows that no metric names is a metric worth adding.

- **PLANT A COMPLETED DROP, so `jobRan` proves the pipeline instead of the
  bot's luck.** The gate says `JobsDone >= 1` and means "a drop can be made end
  to end: posted, walked to, completed, paid, laundered". What it measures is
  whether the bot won a footrace. Across 64 runs the outfit cuts the player off
  on seven, and on six of those `jobsDone=1` cleared the bound by accident — so
  the gate has been passing for the wrong reason far more often than it has
  failed. **Deliberately not loosened**: accepting "cut off before any drop"
  would let a run that never exercised the drop pipeline pass silently, which is
  rule 6 exactly. The fix is to make one drop reliably complete. `[series] jobs`
  now prints each drop's day, the distance when it opened and the closest the
  bot got, which says whether it was walking and ran out of night or never went
  — read that before choosing a mechanism. Prime suspect is `frameWorstMs=43666`:
  one forty-three-second frame crosses 02:00 while the walk gets a single step.
