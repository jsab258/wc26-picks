## Why this file exists

On 3 August I dispatched five Windows builds in two hours and, four times,
**ended the turn instead of picking up the next thing** — twenty, thirty-two,
nineteen and twenty-eight minutes with nothing of mine landing. AUTO MODE rule 2
already forbade exactly that, in my own words, and I broke it four times in one
afternoon.

The cause was not forgetting the rule. It was that **the moment after a dispatch
is a decision point**, and a decision point at the end of a long turn is where
turns end. Nothing was written down, so "what next" meant re-deriving priorities
from a 400-line roadmap, and that is enough friction to lose to.

So the queue is written BEFORE the dispatch, and the rule becomes mechanical:
dispatch, then take the top non-CI item off this list. No judgement required at
the point where judgement was failing.

It lives in the repository rather than in a task list because the container is
ephemeral and the task list is not — rule 12's principle, applied to my own
scheduling instead of to CI's output.

## How to use it

- **Every item is sized to fit inside one build round trip (~28 min).** An item
  that cannot be finished in that window gets split until it can, or it will be
  abandoned half-done when the build lands.
- **CI-needed items are marked.** Those get batched into the next dispatch;
  they are never a reason to stop working.
- Take from the top. Move finished items out — this file records what is NEXT,
  not what happened. Done work is in the git log.

## Now

1. **THE WALK COST THE STREET ITS CONVERSATIONS — 24 a run down to 7.** Measured
   across sixteen verdicts, before and after the pace change. Slower people meet
   each other less. The gate asks `confabs > 0` and so fired only on the single
   run that landed on zero; a seventy percent collapse sat inside a passing check
   for four hours. *(CI)* Read `confabTooFar` against `confabOffRoad` and
   `confabWidest` before touching anything — the cause has two candidates and I
   have been wrong about this shape twice tonight.
   **The gate itself is wrong and wants replacing whatever the cause turns out
   to be:** a bound that only catches total failure is a liveness check wearing
   a quality check's name.
2. **The nameplate wall: three outcomes, now all counted.** *(CI)* Offered and
   active agree at 43, so the declutter sees everything. Read
   `nameTagsHidden` as a peak against `nameTagsUnresolved` — suppression never
   firing and two-fifths of labels never reaching the placement loop have
   completely different repairs.
3. **Read the green sweep** and ship the source green that lands on 0.82. *(CI)*
4. **Read `premises` and `companionSight`.** *(CI)* Houses were unreachable
   under a green test; the escort was stranded by the same pace change as the
   confabs. Both fixed, neither confirmed.
5. **Jafar runs BODIES.bat ~10:00 CEST.** `bodyChoices` 2 → 6.

## Next

**CORRECTED — "raise the population" and "make the street busier" are two
different changes and this queue conflated them.** `CrowdWalkerCap = 12` bounds
how many bodies are out of doors within earshot, whatever `CityPlan.Count` is,
and it was set from measurement rather than ambition: at 3,000 residents there
were 333 people standing within 34m of the bar door, so the caps were not
thinning a crowd, they were choosing 28 out of a mob and spawning every one on
top of the player. Raising the count from 700 to 1,400 buys FAMILIARITY — 43.5
distinct faces a week against 47.4 — and changes the frame not at all. Whether
a dozen people in a plaza reads as a street or as a demonstration is a judgement
for Jafar off a still, not a number for me to move against a measured decision.


6. **Raise the population instead of cutting districts.** Measured, and it
   reverses the plan: seven districts at 1,400 people gives 43.5 distinct faces
   a week against 47.4 for three at 700, and 2,100 beats the cut outright. What
   is NOT measured is whether a fuller city still reads as a port rather than a
   crowd — that is a question for a still. Change the headcount, look, decide.
7. **Tier the cast — and the runtime is not the constraint.** All three sides
   measured. Design: 47 distinct faces a week, 13 near enough to read, a knee at
   ~50 people covering 92% of a resident's week. Witnesses: no fewer than ~20
   near an event. Runtime: 68 rigs cost 1.1ms of a 12ms budget. **The machine
   does not bound the cast at fifty; only authoring does.**
8. **M17.2 voices** — no longer held. The writing verdict came back 78 and the
   risk it was gating (paying to voice something that needs rewriting) is
   retired. Note this is a SPEND and Jafar has not authorised it.
9. **Six cards still lack example lines**, down from sixty. Small, local, no key
   needed to identify them.

## Blocked, and on whom

- **THE MONEY DOES NOT MATCH THE DECADE, and it is a decision rather than a
  fault.** The cast deals in shillings, half a crown, pence and two-and-six —
  pre-decimal British currency, gone in 1971 — while `Tier2Gen` dates the world
  to the eighties and nineties by listing CDs, pagers and car phones as
  in-period. Seven references across the sixty cards, now counted by `--audit`
  and deliberately not rejected: refusing sixty cards over an unmade decision is
  the ratchet rule 5 warns about. Two ways out, both cheap, and it is Jafar's
  call: move the era back, or move the money forward. Worth noting the era is
  load-bearing rather than flavour — a late-analog city is what makes missed
  calls, wiretaps and being unreachable into mechanics.

- **A character mesh.** Only Jafar can buy one, and it is now the single
  largest immersion gap in the project — see roadmap 17.1b.
- **Any further API spend.** The 3 August authorisation covered two tasks, both
  done, ~£0.85. Nothing else is approved and nothing else gets spent.

## Done, kept here only until the next tidy

- The upside-down player, closed by looking at the frame: two independent
  faults in our own rig, both fixed, a figure on its feet in the noon still.
- The nameplate that measured 2,119 times the frame height — the screen-rect
  helper projected two diagonal corners of a rotating box. Now 0.825.
- The rest days were never unrun; I read screenshot filenames as run length.
- Parallel builds; the work queue and its checker; the Tier-2 generator's
  thirteen writing rules with a no-key self-test; example lines for 54 of the
  60 generated cards; the conversation probe and a measured 78; per-character
  geometric cost; M19 input parity.

## How to keep this file honest

- **Dispatch, then immediately take item 1 of Now.** A build in flight is a
  reason to switch tasks, never a reason to stop.
- **Arming a watcher is the PRECONDITION for ending a turn, not permission to
  end one.** Both are required and only one of them feels like progress.
- **Batch Game-layer changes, and dispatch hypotheses in parallel** — each build
  keeps its own verdict under `sim-shots/runs/<sha>.txt`, so concurrent builds
  are concurrent answers.
- **Prefer a local answer.** Before dispatching, ask whether the question is
  actually about Unity. Item 1 above is not.

## Standing work

**This section never empties, and that is its entire job.** The queue ran dry on
3 August after an hour of good work, because every item was sized to fit inside
one build round trip — so an hour of good work consumed the list, and an empty
list read as an empty afternoon. Three gaps of 21, 28 and 28 minutes followed.

When `## Now` has nothing startable in it, the next action is to take one of
these and decompose it into `## Now` — NOT to end the turn. Running out of short
items is a refill signal, not a stop signal.

- **M21, the two ledgers.** Empire growth, law as a tool, what expansion costs
  you. Entirely unbuilt, entirely Core, so entirely doable here without a round
  trip. This is the largest piece of unwritten game left.
- **M22, the shape of a playthrough.** Onboarding, pacing, replayability,
  succession. Also unbuilt and also Core-shaped.
- **Read a system and write down what it actually does.** Every system in this
  project has at least one comment that is now false; three were found today,
  one of them in the file being edited at the time. The supply is effectively
  unlimited and each one found is a bug that would otherwise have been believed.
- **Turn a still into a number.** Four faults have now been found by opening a
  frame and none by a gate — the newest being a naked body with a metric
  reporting it clothed. Anything a frame shows that no metric names is a metric
  worth adding.
