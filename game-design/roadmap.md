# LEDGER — Reconciled Roadmap (v1, 2026-07-25)

The founding doc's milestone list (§11) and our built reality have drifted — mostly
because M1/M2 were re-scoped by player decisions (gossip first, then the week campaign).
This document reconciles the two: what §11 called "M1 living block / M2 double-life MVP"
is partially built; several doc systems were missed along the way and are folded back in
below. This supersedes §11's numbering going forward.

## Where we actually are (vs. the doc)

Built and CI-validated: schedules, day/night, gossip propagation with decay and
contradiction (§6.2 core), suspicion values (§6.4 partial), damage-control verbs with
trait-gated outcomes (§6.4's "game state decides, LLM performs" — honored), the week
campaign (win/lose/economy), 4 conversational NPCs with persistent markdown memory +
reflection (§6.1 fully honored), balance lab, full-week sim in CI.

## Missed items found on doc reread (2026-07-25)

1. **"Never ground truth" violation (§6.2).** The damage-control buttons key off the
   actual rumor network state — the player is omniscient about who holds what. The doc is
   explicit: the player sees what they *believe* the city knows. Fix: a PlayerKnowledge
   model — a lead becomes actionable only once learned (an NPC alludes to it in
   conversation, you witnessed the witness, or a friendly NPC warns you). The Ledger UI
   (v0) renders this belief-state — it is the game's title and was missing from all plans.
2. **Clean/dirty money (§6.7) — missed entirely.** One cash pool today. Night pay must be
   dirty; spending dirty money visibly is evidence; the bar launders (capacity upgradeable
   — this absorbs the earlier "bar investment" M3 idea). Lifestyle purchases raise
   "how does he afford that?" suspicion when clean income doesn't cover them.
3. **Secrets are loot (§6.3, novelty claim #3) — entirely unbuilt.** Everything flows
   one way today (rumors about the player). The player's offensive half — learning NPC
   secrets in conversation, holding hooks, spending them for favors/coercion/protection —
   is a top-5 novelty claim and appears in no milestone. Scheduled M4.
4. **Suspicion thresholds → behavior (§6.4).** Suspicion is a number that colors dialogue;
   the doc requires escalating behavior: probing questions → checking with others →
   confrontation. Scheduled M4 alongside Ossei.
5. **The investigator is already authored (§8).** The "constable at high heat" idea from
   the M3/M4 discussion has a name: **Detective Mara Ossei** — patient, personal,
   incorruptible-so-far. Build her as written.
6. **End-of-day ledger summary (§4).** The Persona-style day anchor (money moved, rumors
   in flight, loyalty shifts, tomorrow's dangling thread) — we have toasts only. Cheap,
   high-impact, M3.
7. **Persistence is a pillar, not polish (P5).** "The city's state is the save file."
   Today rumors/campaign state don't survive a restart while NPC memories do — an
   inconsistent world. Promoted from "M8 hardening" to M4.
8. **Cost envelope telemetry (§9).** Target < $0.05/hour ambient, "measured from day
   one." CostTracker exists but no per-hour readout. Small M3 task (F1 + sim report).
9. **Output validator (§9).** Character-break/length/leak checks on LLM output — M5.
10. **No-hard-timers rule (§4) vs. drop windows.** The nightly 22:00–02:00 job window is
    defensible as a *scheduled obligation* (the doc's middle loop is built on those), not
    a FOMO countdown — but it's the closest thing we have to a timer. Watch it in
    playtest; if it feels like a countdown, soften (the outfit waits, but patience decays
    per hour late).

## Open items needing a player decision (flagged, not blocking)

- **Cast drift vs. doc.** Doc: Sam = first friend/coworker (day-life ring); Ada =
  landlady. Ours (approved cards): Sam = street go-between, Ada = retired teacher.
  Recommendation: keep our approved cards — they fit the one-street scale — and re-home
  the doc's "first friend" role in a future coworker when the day job exists. The doc's
  §8 cast list gets revised at vertical-slice time.
- **Melee combat.** Doc §11-M2 wanted a graybox melee pass; doc risk #1 says "no combat
  v1." Recommendation: stay combat-free until after the vertical slice; revisit with the
  Sleeping-Dogs-lineage spec (§6.5) as its own milestone if the game needs it.

## The plan forward

- **M3 — The honest ledger** (next; starts after the PC playtest + tuning):
  1. PlayerKnowledge + Ledger UI v0 — belief-state, never ground truth; damage-control
     verbs re-keyed to it. The playtest build's omniscient buttons become "learned leads."
  2. Clean/dirty money + laundering through the bar (absorbs bar investment).
  3. Disguise/appearance v0 — day/night clothing state feeding witness confidence.
  4. End-of-day ledger summary screen.
  5. Schedule-conflict story beats (a day-world invitation colliding with a drop window).
  6. Consequential loyalty (visible, affects warnings: a loyal NPC tells you what they
     heard before it spreads — which also feeds PlayerKnowledge naturally).
  7. Cost-per-hour telemetry surfaced.
- **M4 — The other side of the street — COMPLETE 2026-07-26**: hooks v1, suspicion
  escalation ladder, Det. Ossei (+witness interviews), save/load — PLUS the audit
  adopt-soon set: recognition barks, eavesdropping channel, debt book, response
  validator. Next stop M5 requires the player: playtest gate, purchases, HDRP, voice,
  Noor approval (drafted). Autonomous pre-M5 runway: balance-lab expansion, Tier-2
  sample ring, onboarding pass, AI-playtest hardening.
- **M5 — Vertical slice** (doc M3): The Hook polished (HDRP swap, city pack, character
  models/Mixamo, audio+voice via ElevenLabs), 5 Tier-1 characters (Rocco, Lena, Sam, one
  love interest — Noor or Elias, player's pick — and Ossei), 7 in-game days of Act I,
  output validator, onboarding. The is-this-fun gate and the demo artifact.
- **M6+ — per doc §11 M4+**: districts/cast/acts expansion, Tier-2 batch pipeline,
  LLM productization (bundled inference, cost model, offline fallback), hardening,
  Steam page. Nemesis-patent design review before any rival-hierarchy work (§6.5 ⚠).

Rule reaffirmed from §2: if a feature serves none of the five novelty claims, it is cut.
